# Research from 2024 IMC Prosperity Challenge

Here were 2024's round scenarios, their real life equivalents, and the strategies to employ:

## Round 1
**Scenario**: Participants have worked with two assets, namely PEARLS, whose price remains relatively constant over time at a value of 10k seashells, and BANANAS, an asset whose price is highly volatile, fluctuating frequently.

Real-life equivalent:
- PEARLS = Stable assets like gold, bonds, or blue-chip stocks (low volatility).
- BANANAS = High-volatility assets like cryptocurrencies, meme stocks (GameStop, AMC), or speculative tech stocks.

Trading Strategy:
- PEARLS: Act as a safe haven. Hold during uncertainty, arbitrage small deviations.
- BANANAS: Trade based on momentum, volatility breakout strategies, or mean reversion if the fluctuations follow a predictable pattern.

## Round 2
**Scenario**: Participants have been provided with data on COCONUTS and PINA_COLADAS. Although the price of COCONUTS and PINA_COLADAS are related, as coconuts are required for the production of pina coladas, the converse is not true.

Real-life equivalent:
- COCONUTS = Raw materials (commodities like crude oil, wheat, or lithium).
- PINA_COLADAS = Products derived from raw materials (e.g., gasoline, flour, batteries).

Trading Strategy:
- Commodity-Product Arbitrage: If coconuts (raw material) become expensive, pina coladas (final product) prices may rise later. Trade based on lead-lag relationships.
- Hedging: If you're holding pina coladas (finished goods), hedge against rising coconut prices by going long coconuts.
- Supply Chain Disruptions: Monitor production constraints—if coconut supply tightens, pina coladas may become overvalued or underproduced.

## Round 3
**Scenario**: Two additional assets were introduced, BERRIES and DIVING_GEAR. The price of BERRIES is seasonal, while that of DIVING_GEAR is influenced by DOLPHIN_SIGHTINGS, another data set provided by IMC. The latter may serve as a feature for predicting the price of DIVING_GEAR.

Real-life equivalent:
- BERRIES = Seasonal assets like agricultural commodities (corn, coffee, natural gas for winter demand).
- DIVING_GEAR = Event-driven assets (e.g., tourism stocks reacting to travel demand, ski gear sales linked to snowfall).

Trading Strategy:
- BERRIES: Use seasonality models. Buy before peak demand and sell before the season ends.
- DIVING_GEAR: Dolphin sightings as a leading indicator suggests predictive modeling. If high dolphin sightings correlate with increased diving activity, go long diving gear before demand spikes.

## Round 4
**Scenario**: Participants have worked with four assets, namely PICNIC_BASKET, UKULELE, DIP, and BAGUETTE. We have been informed that one PICNIC_BASKET consists of one UKULELE, two BAGUETTEs, and four DIPs. However, the price of PICNIC_BASKET is not equivalent to the sum of the prices of its individual components.

Real-life equivalent:
- PICNIC_BASKET = ETFs, mutual funds, or product bundles.
- UKULELE, DIP, BAGUETTE = Underlying assets that contribute to the basket's value (stocks in an ETF, ingredients in a meal kit, or components of an index fund).

Trading Strategy:
- Basket Mispricing: If PICNIC_BASKET is cheaper or more expensive than its sum-of-parts, arbitrage the difference.
- Synthetic Replication: If PICNIC_BASKET is overpriced, short it and buy the individual components.
- Market Inefficiencies: If demand for one component spikes (e.g., BAGUETTE becomes rare), the basket’s pricing may become skewed.

## Round 5
**Scenario**: During this round, participants were granted access to IMC trader bots trading history and were given the opportunity to replicate, or take profit from the strategy of the most experienced bots.

Real-life equivalent:
- High-frequency trading (HFT) firms, hedge fund signals, or copy trading in forex/crypto.

Trading Strategy:
- Backtest the Bots: Analyze the bot’s patterns—do they trade momentum, mean reversion, or arbitrage?
- Copy Trading & Front Running: If a bot moves the market predictably, position ahead of its trades.
- Reverse Engineering: If the bots have weaknesses (e.g., overreacting to news), trade against them when they overextend.
